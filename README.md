# Sample Dagger Hilt 

Repository that contains a sample of Dagger Hilt that I've built for my [medium article](https://github.com/robercoding/DaggerHilt-Sample-Guide) in ***spanish***, it covers the basic-intermediate level, feel free to read itðŸ˜Š.

#### What is Dagger Hilt?
Dagger Hilt is a dependency injection framework perform operations in compile-time for Android. 
Hilt works by code generating your Dagger setup code for you. This takes away most of the boilerplate of using Dagger and really just leaves the aspects of defining **how to create objects and where to inject them**.
